    This interactive essay acts as a supplement to the long-form essay available in the Norton Critical Edition of Absalom, Absalom!. It includes visualizations that are not possible to represent in print, and also functions as a standalone essay that explores Absalom, Absalom! along three different axes: Characters, Events, and Language.

<p class = "notebook">
The Digital Yoknapatawpha database contains every character who appears in Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha fictions.
Each character has a set of attribute information, including their race, class, gender, number, rank, and vitality.
With this information, we can make a literary demography of the composition of the entire character population.
One of the most salient pieces of demographic information in Absalom, Absalom! is race.

  Racial segregation was a central feature of the American South before the Civil Rights Movement.
  Faulkner was highly sensitive to how this artificial ‘color line’ structured social relations.

  <p style = "padding: 8px 8px; border-left: 6px solid whitesmoke;">Simply counting the total number of characters in a text does not account for the number of times they occur in the text.

    Statistically speaking, there is only one Moor in Shakespeare’s Othello, but as he appears in nearly every scene he is one of the most present characters.
    
    We can weight for character presence by calculating how often they occur in an event.</p>

    The data suggest that while Absalom, Absalom! is concerned with the ‘color line’, it is decidedly from a White perspective.
Race and racial passing is only conceived in how it might trouble Whiteness and not how it might affect the Black community.

    <div class = "notebook"></div>
    <p class = "notebook">
It is clear from reading Absalom, Absalom! that the novel is about Charles Bon’s potential transgression across the ‘color line.’ The data reveal that the novel attends to this issue from a predominantly White perspective, and at the exclusion of all other non-white characters.
The various narrators only really care about racial passing if it threatens upper class white femininity.
As such, they naturalize racial difference, and also circumscribe the boundaries of gender, sexuality, and class.
In the highly fraught social circumstances of the pre-Civil Rights South, there is no way to separate race, class, gender, and sexuality.</p>
