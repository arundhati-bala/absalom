				<p class="notebook">
					<i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> resists summary. It is told from multiple, contradictory perspectives that each re-tell the same set of historical events. As each narrator tries to understand <i>why</i> the events happened they fundamentally reshape what happens. The facts, such as they are, can be described as follows:


					<div class="fade_text">Thomas Sutpen arrives in Jefferson and marries Ellen Coldfield. </div>
					<div class="fade_text">
						He has a son.
					</div>
					<div class="fade_text">
						Henry
					</div>
					<div class="fade_text">
						He has a daughter.
					</div>
					<div class="fade_text">
						Judith
					</div>
					<div class="fade_text">Judith falls in love with Henry’s friend from college...</div>
					<div class="fade_text">
						Charles Bon
					</div>
					<div class="fade_text">
						On the day Judith and Charles are supposed to marry, Henry kills him and disappears.
					</div>
					<div class="fade_text">
						No one knows why.
					</div>
					<div class="fade_text">
						Everyone has a theory.
					</div>

				</p>
				<p class="notebook">
					The different tellers of the tale, Miss Rosa, Mr. Compson, Quentin, and Shreve, all have their own motivations for telling the story in a particular way. These motivations are never stated explicitely. What is revealing is not just what the narrators say, but also what they do not say. Each teller leaves out important clues that help the reader understand what happened. Consequently, there is no way for the reader to ever get the "whole" story.
				</p>
				<p class="notebook">
					While discussing <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> at the University of Virginia in 1958 an audience member asked if any of the narrators had the right view.

				<div class="notebook">
					<div class="quote narrow">

					Though the plot can be very confusing, it is clear from Faulkner’s notes that he had an underlying structure. This underlying structure is sometimes referred to as the <em>chronology</em> or <em>story</em>. The story is important to distinguish from the plot. Though <em>story</em> and <em>plot</em> are often used interchangeably, technically the former refers to the order of events as they happen chronologically, while the latter indicates the order in which they are told. If Faulkner had told us the order of events in which they occured, rather than telling them out of order, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> would be easier to understand. Indeed, it is for this very reason that his publishers asked him to include a chronology in the first edition of the text, so readers could get some grasp of the basic structure of the story. The structure of this chronology is already visible in the <a href="http://faulkner.iath.virginia.edu/media/resources/MANUSCRIPTS/AAMS1.html">early manuscript</a> pages of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>

				<h2>Narratology</h2>
				<p class="notebook">
					Narratology is the study of narrative, and it can provide insight into how <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is structured. By distinguishing between the order events as they occur (story) and the order in which they are told (plot), it is possible to create a chart of the plot structure. In such a chart, the story is placed on the y-axis and the plot indicated by page numbers is placed on the x-axis. As the chart moves to the right, it moves forward in the progression of the text. Whenever something is plot higher or lower on the y-axis, it indicates when something is happening earlier (lower) or later (higher) chronologically. This concept is easier to grasp by looking at some major events in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> in story and plot order.

				Digital Yoknapatawpha has broken down the novel into 644 individual events. <br>
				An event is any time there is one or more characters at one location for a discrete period of time.<br>
				Each of the 644 events in the novel was also assigned a number that indicates its order in the plot and in the story/chronology.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="notebook">
				The overlapping and disjointed versions of events capture Quentin’s lived experience of exploring the past. This is not a neat linear chronology told by one authority in a history book, but the collective story of multiple voices who have shaped and reshaped the events to match their version of the truth. The tellers cannot be separated from their tales. It forces us to wonder if any version of the past can ever be true, or if it is simply another story we tell ourselves.

				Each narrator actually follows a similar pattern. They start the narration in the “deep” past and work their way into the present. They often repeat similar details, but leave out crucial information.

			<h1>PLOT STRUCTURE CHART HERE</h1>
			<p class="notebook">
				We can get better insight into how Faulkner structured Absalom, Absalom! by displaying which parts of the story each chapter covers. In story mode we see a very mottled line with each chapter seemingly covering all parts of the story.
				<br><br>
				By clicking on each chapter legend entry, we can turn that series on and off, and determine what parts of the story each chapter covers.
